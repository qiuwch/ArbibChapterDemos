# # Introduction
# 
# ** What's IPython notebook?**
# 
# "The IPython Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document" http://ipython.org/notebook.html
# 
# In IPython Notebook, you can use python code to perform various computations.
# 

# In[2]:

# This is a short demo of the notebookâ€™s basic features by the Pybonacci team
# In linux or mac: ipython notebook is started with command "ipython notebook" in command line
# In windows: just open it from start menu, after installing it

# # Installation of IPython notebook

# Here's a very brief installation guide. If it's not detailed enough, check instruction from [link](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), google it, or contact [qiuwch@gmail.com](qiuwch@gmail.com) for help.
# 
# **Windows:**  
# The simpliest way is to install Anaconda (a python distribution for scientific computation).  
# https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/
# 
# **Linux/Mac:**
# 1. Install pip with package manager (for ubuntu, it's **apt-get install pip**).
# 2. Use pip to install dependencies (ipython, numpy, scipy, etc.)   
# **pip install ipython numpy scipy**
# 3. In terminal, change directory to where contains the ipynb file. Then use **ipython notebook** to launch ipython notebook.
# 
# **NOTE:** Installation of ipython notebook should take less than ten minutes. If you have difficulty with installation, contact  qiuwch@gmail.com.

# # Usage

# If you have programming experience with a programming language like C, MATLAB, R. Python should be easy to grasp.
# You can find a lot of tutorials on the web.
# 
# Here is a video tutorial to show how to use python in IPython notebook. The videos 1-5 (skip 2) are enough for this course. It's suitable for beginner **without** python knowledge.
