      "This homework contains code demo to illustrate concepts from the lectures. The code is written in python language. To run these demos, [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is required. The IPython Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document. In this [link](0.IPythonNotebookBasic.ipynb), we provide instructions of getting started with this tool.\n",
